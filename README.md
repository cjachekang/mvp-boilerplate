# mvp-boilerplate

An open-source boilerplate for creating MVPs. The goal is to provide the tools to add as much functionality as you want, while providing the most bare-bones experience to lower the learning curve. The idea is that mvps typically need to be as stripped down as possible.

There should be:

1. Landing Page
1. Frontend
1. Backend
1. Database
1. Payment Processing
1. Email Integration
1. Hosting

There is more specific documentation in the frontend and backend in their respective folders.

## mvp-frontend

The frontend uses Typescript, React, Vite, Tailwind, Shadcn.

## mvp-backend

The backend uses Python, FastAPI, Supabase.
